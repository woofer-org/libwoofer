/**
 * SECTION:wfsong
 * @title: Woofer Song
 * @short_description: The application's song object derived from #GObject
 *
 * This modules provides and handles everything regarding songs.  A single
 * object represents one song with its own URI, metadata, statistics and more.
 * Song objects are, together with main components such as player, application,
 * library and settings, crucial modules that form the fundamentals of the
 * application.  Song objects are the objects that are used to represent the
 * content of the song library, used to play audio and they can exist from a few
 * to potentially thousands of instances.
 *
 * The song library, living as a separate module, is sometimes referred to as
 * 'song list' or simply 'list' in this module, as the songs are linked together
 * in a two-way linked list structure.
